Ministry of New and Renewable Energy Sources Schemes Solar power projects can be set up anywhere in the country, however, the solar power projects developed in a scattered manner lead to higher project cost per MW and higher transmission losses. Individual projects of smaller capacity incur significant expenses in site development, drawing separate transmission lines to the nearest substation, procuring water, and creating other necessary infrastructure. It also takes longer for project developers to acquire land, get all types of clearances and permissions, etc. which ultimately delays the project. To overcome these challenges, the scheme for “Development of Solar Parks and Ultra-Mega Solar Power Projects” was rolled out in December 2014 with an objective to facilitate the solar project developers to set up projects expeditiously....
